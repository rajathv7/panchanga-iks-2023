## Introduction
India is home to one of the oldest and continuously surviving living civilizations on the face of the Earth. Therefore, it is only natural that several time-keeping strategies would have evovled in this part of the world over centuries, if not millenia. But unfortunately, a study tracing the development of various such ideas in an unbiased and scientific manner is lacking in post-Independence (1947 CE) India. Even some of the simpler aspects in daily use are also not taught in schools under the pretext of secularism. It is high-time that this lacuna be corrected and the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has come at this opportune moment. In this context, here is a small effort to uncover some of the basic aspects of time-keeping techniques practiced in the Indian sub-continent from a very ancient time. 

## Background 
In the wake of the rapid technological progress since the industrial revolution, some of the techniques adopted in ancient civilizations have become obsolete and many others are relegated to oblivion. However, the time-keeping based on the movement of celestial objects still continues to be in vogue in the Indian sub-
continent, at least for religious purposes. Just after India’s independence from the British, there was an effort to study the Indian Calendar Systems and constitute an Indian National Calendar. Although such a calendar was proposed, it did not find acceptance either for religious purposes nor for
the affairs of the state. Hence, seven decades later we have fallen back on the Gregorian calendar for official purposes and the various traditional pañcāṅga-s for religious purposes. There are some differences in the various pañcāṅga-s published from different places today, probably because of the method of computation and models (and their underlying parameters) used. Here, we set out to understand the basic scientific principles behind a pañcāṅga and document differences observed between different pañcāṅga-s.

## Terminologies
As mentioned earlier, the motion of celestial bodies was a very important aspect of time-keeping. As per today's understanding, the oldest surviving literature is the Rigveda, which was most likely composed by people inhabiting today's Punjab and Haryana i.e., the banks of Sindhu-Sarasvati, otherwise known as the Sapta-sindhu (land of seven rivers). It is to be kept at the back of our mind that the earliest record of Indian civilization is therefore more temperate (latitude of about 30 degree North) than tropical.

The two celestial bodies nobody can miss are the Sun and the Moon. So, we start from there. Today, we know that the Earth revolves around the Sun. But an observer stationed on the Earth would not easily be able to tell whether the Earth revolves around the Sun or otherwise, based on naked-eye observations alone. All ancient civilizations and likewise our ancients made all their observations from the Earth, and so our discussion here also will talk from the same perspective. Since the Sun is seen to rise in the East and set in the West; and also move with respect to the background stars, our ancients naturally
took the Sun to be a moving celestial object (at least initially). The time ‘taken’ by the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth is called an
year. Perhaps in the earliest olden days, this was called a yuga. Even today, we celebrate the beginning of a new year as yugādi. But the more popular name for the time taken by the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth is समा or संवत्सर. One may recall the famous श्लोक from रामायणम् here "मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः। यत् क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकम् अवधीः काममोहितम्॥"

Every day, the Sun appears to rise in the East and set in the West. This is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis (This is mentioned by Āryabhaṭa himself). The axis of rotation of the Earth is titled with respect to the plane of revolution of the Earth by about 23.5 degrees. This
gives rise to seasons on the Earth. The plane in which the Sun appears to go round the Earth is called ‘ecliptic’, as shown in red colour in Figure 1. The ecliptic makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the Earth’s equator. As seen in the figure, there are four cardinal points on the ecliptic, namely winter solstice, summer solstice, vernal equinox and autumnal equinox. The vernal and autumnal equinox points lie on the intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator. The summer solstice point is the Northern-most point of the ecliptic and the winter solstice point the Southern-most. From the time of winter solstice till the summer solstice, the length of the day increases progressively in the Northern henisphere. Hence, for us in India the period of uttarāyaṇa begins from winter solstice and extends till summer solstice. Similarly, from the time of summer solstice till winter solstice, the length of the day descreases progressively in the
Northern hemisphere. Hence, we say dakṣiṇāyana begins from summer solstice and extendstill winter solstice. Therefore, one year is divided into two ayanas – uttarāyaṇa and dakṣiṇāyana. 

Uttarāyaṇa said to be the day of the devas and dakṣiṇāyana is said to be the night of the devas. Notice that in the Northern hemisphere, summer solstice has the longest duration of day while winter solstice has the shortest duration of day. The length of day and night will be exactly equal on the days of the equinox. The
equinoxes are sometimes called viṣuvat in Indian languages, sometimes viṣuvat may be loosely used for solstices too. The word viṣuvat comes the root viṣḷ, meaning ‘to spread’. Hence, viṣu is sometimes taken as the center out of which something can spread. If an year is reckoned from winter solstice to winter solstice, then the center of the year will fall on summer solstice, which was called viṣuvat in ancient times. Later on, viṣuvat came to be associated with the center of each ayana, and therefore became associated with the equinoxes. Now, the tropical year is defined as the time between two successive vernals equinoxes or between two successive winter solstice points. Note that the average length of the tropical year is 365.2425 days. The seasons on Earth are determined by this tropical year.
