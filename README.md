# IKS Panchanga Project 

## Introduction
India is home to one of the oldest and continuously surviving living civilizations on the face of the Earth. Therefore, it is only natural that several time-keeping strategies would have evovled in this part of the world over centuries, if not millenia. But unfortunately, a study tracing the development of various such ideas in an unbiased and scientific manner is lacking in post-Independence (1947 CE) India. Even some of the simpler aspects in daily use are also not taught in schools under the pretext of secularism. It is high-time that this lacuna be corrected and the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has come at this opportune moment. In this context, here is a small effort to uncover some of the basic aspects of time-keeping techniques practiced in the Indian sub-continent from a very ancient time.
